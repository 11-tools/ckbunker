# Text Message Signing

Visit the tab "Tools". You can type in a short text message (single line is best) and
select a derivation path to be used for signing. Segwit or classic bitcoin address
is an option as well.

Base64 signature in standard form is provided. The address is underneath.

Keep in mind when you share a signature, you are also sharing the public key for
that address. This is a little more information than just a payment address.
